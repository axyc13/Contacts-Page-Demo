# WDCC Contacts Page Deployment with MongoDB

This is the final completed project that was achieved over the course of 2 months with the WDCC team at the University of Auckland.

The final web app is a contacts page created using React and CSS, hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) 

This is my first web app deployment, and you can access the <strong>frontend [here](https://contacts-page-mongo-1.onrender.com/)</strong> (may need to refresh a few times to load properly) and the **backend [here](https://contacts-page-mongo.onrender.com/api/contacts)**

Huge thanks to the WDCC team for guiding me through this web dev journey! I learned a lot :)
