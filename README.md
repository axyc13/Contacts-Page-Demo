# WDCC Contacts Page Deployment with MongoDB

This is the final completed project that was achieved over the course of 2 months with the WDCC team at the University of Auckland.

This is my first web app deployment and you can access the frontend here: https://contacts-page-mongo.onrender.com/api/contacts
And the back end here: https://contacts-page-mongo.onrender.com/api/contacts

Huge thanks to the WDCC team for guiding my through this web dev journey! I learned a lot :)
